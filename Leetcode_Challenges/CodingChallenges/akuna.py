1. Trade Reconciliation - Parsing
In order to verify records, Akuna compares information on its own trades against records from third-party exchanges - we call this reconciliation. As a simple example, consider this data. Akuna records show we bought 10 units of product A at 12:01:00, and that we sold 15 units of product B at 12:05:00.:



AKUNA,A,10,12:01:00

AKUNA,B,-15,12:05:00



If the exchange has the same record, that's a perfect reconciliation:



EXCHANGE,A,10,12:01:00

EXCHANGE,B,-15,12:05:00



We trade across multiple exchanges and in much larger volume than this, so sometimes there are missing records on one side called breaks. Breaks can occur on either side - e.g. Akuna has a trade not seen in the exchange's records, or vice versa.



You will be provided input as comma-separated lines of two types:

SOURCE,PRODUCT,QUANTITY,TIMESTAMP        # Represents a trade record.
RECONCILIATION,SOURCE,COUNTERPARTY       # Represents a reconciliation request.
The item's SOURCE is either Akuna or one of many exchanges, notated EXCHANGE#. The PRODUCT, QUANTITY, and TIMESTAMP represent trade information.

On lines representing a trade record (SOURCE,PRODUCT,QUANTITY,TIMESTAMP), return the quantity specified in the trade record.



On lines representing a reconciliation request, return the number of trades belonging to the given SOURCE that aren't matched by the given COUNTERPARTY.



Example 1

Input:

AKUNA,A,10,12:01:00
AKUNA,B,-15,12:05:00
RECONCILIATION,AKUNA,EXCHANGE1
RECONCILIATION,EXCHANGE1,AKUNA
EXCHANGE1,B,-15,12:05:00
EXCHANGE1,B,-20,12:07:00
RECONCILIATION,AKUNA,EXCHANGE1
RECONCILIATION,EXCHANGE1,AKUNA
RECONCILIATION,EXCHANGE2,AKUNA
Output:

10          # quantity 10
-15         # quantity -15
2           # AKUNA has 2 trades unmatched by EXCHANGE1 (input lines 1-2)
0           # EXCHANGE1 has 0 trades unmatched by AKUNA
-15         # quantity -15
-20         # quantity -20
1           # AKUNA has 1 trade unmatched by EXCHANGE1 (input line 1)
1           # EXCHANGE1 has 1 trade unmatched by AKUNA (input line 6)
0           # EXCHANGE2 has no trades, thus 0 unmatched by AKUNA
